# npBNN - Bayesian Neural Networks
The npBNN package is a Python implementation of Bayesian neural networks for classification, using the Numpy and Scipy libraries. The program is described in this pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04987.

The example file `npBNN.py` shows how to set up a BNN model, train it, and use it to make predictions.
